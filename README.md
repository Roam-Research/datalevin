> I love Datalog, why hasn't everyone used this already?

Datalevin is a simple durable [Datalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog)
database. Here's what a Datalog query looks like in Datalevin:

```Clojure
(d/q '[:find  ?name ?total
       :in    $ ?year
       :where [?sales :sales/year ?year]
              [?sales :sales/total ?total]
              [?sales :sales/customer ?customer]
              [?customer :customers/name ?name]]
      (d/db conn) 2024)
```

## :question: Why

The rationale is to have a simple, fast and open source Datalog query engine
running on durable storage.

It is our observation that many developers prefer
the flavor of Datalog popularized by [DatomicÂ®](https://www.datomic.com) over
any flavor of SQL, once they get to use it. Perhaps it is because Datalog is
more declarative and composable than SQL, e.g. the automatic implicit joins seem
to be its killer feature. In addition, the recursive rules feature of Datalog
makes it suitable for graph processing and deductive reasoning.

The feature set of DatomicÂ® may not be a good fit for some use cases. One thing that may [confuse some users](https://vvvvalvalval.github.io/posts/2017-07-08-Datomic-this-is-not-the-history-youre-looking-for.html) is its [temporal features](https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/whatis/data-model.html#time-model). To keep things simple and familiar, Datalevin behaves the same way as most other databases: when data are deleted, they are gone. Datalevin also follows the widely accepted principles of ACID, instead of introducing [unusual semantics](https://jepsen.io/analyses/datomic-pro-1.0.7075).

Datalevin started out as a port of
[Datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript) in-memory Datalog database to
[LMDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Memory-Mapped_Database) for
persistence. We then added a [cost-based query optimizer](doc/query.md),
resulting in query performance [competitive](benchmarks/JOB-bench) against SQL
RDBMS such as PostgreSQL.

Datalevin can be used as a library, embedded in applications to manage state, e.g.
used like SQLite; or it can run in a networked
[client/server](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/blob/master/doc/server.md)
mode (default port is 8898) with full-fledged role-based access control (RBAC)
on the server, e.g. used like PostgreSQL.

Datalevin relies on the robust ACID transactional database features of LMDB.
Designed for concurrent read intensive workloads, LMDB also [performs
well](http://www.lmdb.tech/bench/ondisk/) in writing large values (> 2KB).
Therefore, it is fine to store documents in Datalevin.

Datalevin can be used as a fast key-value store for
[EDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Data_Notation) data. The native
EDN data capability of Datalevin should be beneficial for Clojure programs.

Moreover, Datalevin has a [built-in full-text search
engine](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/blob/master/doc/search.md) that has
[competitive](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/tree/master/benchmarks/search-bench)
search performance.

project. There are also several other options. Please see details in
[Installation Documentation](doc/install.md)

## :birthday: Upgrade

Please read
[Upgrade
Documentation](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/blob/master/doc/upgrade.md)
for information regarding upgrading your existing Datalevin database from older
versions.

## :tada: Usage

Datalevin is aimed to be a versatile database.

### Use as a Datalog store

In addition to [our API doc](https://cljdoc.org/d/datalevin/datalevin),
since Datalevin has almost the same Datalog API as Datascript, which in turn has
almost the same API as DatomicÂ®, please consult the abundant tutorials, guides
and learning sites available online to learn about the usage of DatomicÂ® flavor
of Datalog.

Here is a simple code example using Datalevin:

```clojure
(require '[datalevin.core :as d])

;; Define an optional schema.
;; Note that pre-defined schema is optional, as Datalevin does schema-on-write.
;; However, attributes requiring special handling need to be defined in schema,
;; e.g. many cardinality, uniqueness constraint, reference type, and so on.
;; Similar to Datascript, Datalevin schemas differ from DatomicÂ®: 
;; - The schema must be a map of maps, not a vector of maps.
;; - It is not `transact`ed into the db but passed when acquiring connections.
;; - Use `update-schema` to update the schema of an open connection to a database.
(def schema {:aka  {:db/cardinality :db.cardinality/many}
             ;; :db/valueType is optional, if unspecified, the attribute will be
             ;; treated as EDN blobs, and may not be optimal for range queries
             :name {:db/valueType :db.type/string
                    :db/unique    :db.unique/identity}})

;; Create DB on disk and connect to it, assume write permission to create given dir
(def conn (d/get-conn "/tmp/datalevin/mydb" schema))
;; or if you have a Datalevin server running on myhost with default port 8898
;; (def conn (d/get-conn "dtlv://myname:mypasswd@myhost/mydb" schema))

;; Transact some data
;; Notice that :nation is not defined in schema, so it will be treated as an EDN blob
(d/transact! conn
             [{:name "Frege", :db/id -1, :nation "France", :aka ["foo" "fred"]}
              {:name "Peirce", :db/id -2, :nation "france"}
              {:name "De Morgan", :db/id -3, :nation "English"}])

;; Query the data
(d/q '[:find ?nation
       :in $ ?alias
       :where
       [?e :aka ?alias]
       [?e :nation ?nation]]
     (d/db conn)
     "fred")
;; => #{["France"]}

;; Retract the name attribute of an entity
(d/transact! conn [[:db/retract 1 :name "Frege"]])

;; Pull the entity, now the name is gone
(d/q '[:find (pull ?e [*])
       :in $ ?alias
       :where
       [?e :aka ?alias]]
     (d/db conn)
     "fred")
;; => ([{:db/id 1, :aka ["foo" "fred"], :nation "France"}])

;; Close DB connection
(d/close conn)
```

### Use as a key-value store

Datalevin packages the underlying LMDB database as a convenient key-value store
for EDN data.

```clojure
(require '[datalevin.core :as d])
(import '[java.util Date])

;; Open a key value DB on disk and get the DB handle
(def db (d/open-kv "/tmp/datalevin/mykvdb"))
;; or if you have a Datalevin server running on myhost with default port 8898
;; (def db (d/open-kv "dtlv://myname:mypasswd@myhost/mykvdb" schema))

;; Define some table (called "dbi", or sub-databases in LMDB) names
(def misc-table "misc-test-table")
(def date-table "date-test-table")

;; Open the tables
(d/open-dbi db misc-table)
(d/open-dbi db date-table)

;; Transact some data, a transaction can put data into multiple tables
;; Optionally, data type can be specified to help with range query
(d/transact-kv
  db
  [[:put misc-table :datalevin "Hello, world!"]
   [:put misc-table 42 {:saying "So Long, and thanks for all the fish"
                        :source "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"}]
   [:put date-table #inst "1991-12-25" "USSR broke apart" :instant]
   [:put date-table #inst "1989-11-09" "The fall of the Berlin Wall" :instant]])

;; Get the value with the key
(d/get-value db misc-table :datalevin)
;; => "Hello, world!"
(d/get-value db misc-table 42)
;; => {:saying "So Long, and thanks for all the fish",
;;     :source "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"}


;; Range query, from unix epoch time to now
(d/get-range db date-table [:closed (Date. 0) (Date.)] :instant)
;; => [[#inst "1989-11-09T00:00:00.000-00:00" "The fall of the Berlin Wall"]
;;     [#inst "1991-12-25T00:00:00.000-00:00" "USSR broke apart"]]

;; This returns a PersistentVector - e.g. reads all data in JVM memory
(d/get-range db misc-table [:all])
;; => [[42 {:saying "So Long, and thanks for all the fish",
;;          :source "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"}]
;;     [:datalevin "Hello, world!"]]

;; This allows you to iterate over all DB keys inside a transaction.
;; You can perform writes inside the transaction.
;; kv is of of type https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.lmdbjava/lmdbjava/latest/org/lmdbjava/CursorIterable.KeyVal.html
;; Avoid long-lived transactions. Read transactions prevent reuse of pages freed by newer write transactions, thus the database can grow quickly.
;; Write transactions prevent other write transactions, since writes are serialized.
;; LMDB advice: http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/index.html
;; Conclusion: It's ok to have long transactions if using a single thread.
(d/visit db misc-table
            (fn [kv]
               (let [k (d/read-buffer (d/k kv) :data)]
                  (when (= k 42)
                    (d/transact-kv db [[:put misc-table 42 "Don't panic"]]))))
              [:all])

(d/get-range db misc-table [:all])
;; => [[42 "Don't panic"] [:datalevin "Hello, world!"]]

;; Delete some data
(d/transact-kv db [[:del misc-table 42]])

;; Now it's gone
(d/get-value db misc-table 42)
;; => nil

;; Close key value db
(d/close-kv db)
```
## :green_book: Documentation

Please refer to the [API
documentation](https://cljdoc.org/d/datalevin/datalevin) for more details.
You may also consult online materials for Datascript or DatomicÂ®, as the Datalog API is
similar.

## :rocket: Status

Datalevin is extensively tested with property-based testing. It is also used
in production at [Juji](https://juji.io).

Running the [benchmark suite adopted from
Datascript](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/tree/master/benchmarks/datascript-bench),
which write 100K random datoms in several conditions, and run several queries on
them, on a Ubuntu Linux server with an Intel i7 3.6GHz CPU and a 1TB SSD drive,
here is how it looks.

<p align="center">
<img src="benchmarks/datascript-bench/Read.png" alt="query benchmark" height="300"></img>
<img src="benchmarks/datascript-bench/Write.png" alt="write benchmark" height="300"></img>
</p>


In all benchmarked queries, Datalevin is the fastest among the three tested
systems, as Datalevin has a [cost based query optimizer](doc/query.md) while Datascript and
Datomic do not. Datalevin also has a caching layer for index access.

See [here](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/tree/master/benchmarks/datascript-bench)
for a detailed analysis of the results.

We also compared Datalevin and PostgreSQL in handling complex queries, using
[Join Order Benchmark](benchmarks/JOB-bench). On a
MacBook Pro, Apple M3 chip with 12 cores, 30 GB memory and 1TB SSD drive, here's
the average times:

<p align="center">
<img src="benchmarks/JOB-bench/means.png" alt="JOB benchmark averages" height="300"></img>
</p>

Datalevin is about 1.3X faster than PostgreSQL on average in running the complex
queries in this benchmark. The gain is mainly in better query execution time due
to higher quality of generated query plans.

For more details, see [here](benchmarks/JOB-bench).

## :floppy_disk: Differences from Datascript

Datascript is developed by [Nikita Prokopov](https://tonsky.me/) that "is built
totally from scratch and is not related by any means to" DatomicÂ®. Datalevin
started out as a port of Datascript to LMDB, but differs from Datascript in more
significant ways than just the difference in data durability and running mode:

* Datalevin has a cost-based query optimizer, so queries are truly declarative
  and clause ordering does not affect query performance.

* Datalevin is not an immutable database, and there is no
  "database as a value" feature.  Since history is not kept, transaction ids are
  not stored.

* Datoms in a transaction are committed together as a batch, rather than being
  saved by `with-datom` one at a time.

* ACID transaction and rollback are supported.

* Lazy results set and spill to disk are supported.

* Entity and transaction integer ids are 64 bits long, instead of 32 bits.

* Respects `:db/valueType`. Currently, most [DatomicÂ® value
  types](https://docs.datomic.com/schema/schema-reference.html#db-valuetype) are
  supported, except uri. Values of the attributes that
  are not defined in the schema or have unspecified types are treated as
  [EDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Data_Notation) blobs, and are
  de/serialized with [nippy](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/nippy).

* In addition to composite tuples, Datalevin also supports heterogeneous and
  homogeneous tuples.

* More query functions, such as `like` and `not-like` that are similar to LIKE
  and NOT LIKE operators in SQL; `in` and `not-in` that are similar to IN and
  NOT IN operators in SQL, among others.

* Has a value leading index (VAE) for datoms with `:db.type/ref` type attribute;
  The attribute and value leading index (AVE) is enabled for all datoms, so
  there is no need to specify `:db/index`, similar to DatomicÂ® Cloud. Does not
  have AEV index, in order to save storage and improve write speed.

* Stored transaction functions of `:db/fn` should be defined with `inter-fn`, for
  function serialization requires special care in order to support GraalVM
  native image. It is the same for functions that need to be passed over the
  wire to server or babashka.

* Attributes are stored in indices as integer ids, thus attributes in index
  access are returned in attribute creation order, not in lexicographic order
  (i.e. do not expect `:b` to come after `:a`). This is the same as DatomicÂ®.

* Has no features that are applicable only for in-memory DBs, such as DB as an
  immutable data structure, DB pretty print, etc.

## :baby: Limitations

* Attribute names have a length limitation: an attribute name cannot be more
  than 511 bytes long, due to LMDB key size limit.

* Because keys are compared bitwise, for range queries to work as expected on an
  attribute, its `:db/valueType` should be specified.

* Floating point `NaN` cannot be stored.

* Big integers do not go beyond the range of `[-2^1015, 2^1015-1]`, the
  unscaled value of big decimal has the same limit.

* The maximum individual value size is 2GB. Limited by the maximum size of
  off-heap byte buffer that can be allocated in JVM.

* The total data size of a Datalevin database has the same limit as LMDB's, e.g.
  128TB on a modern 64-bit machine that implements 48-bit address spaces.

* Currently supports Clojure on JVM 8 or the above, but adding support for other
  Clojure-hosting runtime is possible, since bindings for LMDB
  exist in almost all major languages and available on most platforms.

## :shopping: Alternatives

If you are interested in using the dialect of Datalog pioneered by DatomicÂ®,
here are your current options:

* If you need time travel and cloud features backed by the company that
  maintains Clojure, and there is no need to see the source code, you may try
  [DatomicÂ®](https://www.datomic.com).

* If you need mainly an in-memory store with optional durability, that has
  almost the same API as DatomicÂ®, you may try
  [Datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript).

* If you need a simple and versatile store with almost the same Datalog API as
  the above two and with a much greater query performance, you may try
  [Datalevin](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin), this project.

* If you need features such as bi-temporal models and SQL, you may try
  [XTDB](https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb).

* If you need a graph database with an open world assumption, you may try
  [Asami](https://github.com/threatgrid/asami).

* If you need a durable store with some storage choices, you may try
  [Datahike](https://github.com/replikativ/datahike).

* There was also [Eva](https://github.com/Workiva/eva/), a distributed store,
  but it is no longer in active development.
